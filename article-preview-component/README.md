### What I learned

Working on this project gave me a deeper understanding of:

- **Custom Popover Implementation**  
  I implemented a popover from scratch without relying on external libraries like Floating UI, giving me full control over positioning, flipping, arrow alignment, and responsive behavior.

- **Dynamic Positioning**  
  I handled edge cases such as insufficient viewport space by calculating layout manually using `getBoundingClientRect`, `ResizeObserver`, and conditional logic (e.g. flip strategies). This included dynamically positioning the arrow relative to the trigger button.

- **Focus Management**  
  I used `react-focus-lock` to trap focus inside the popover, ensuring accessibility for keyboard users and a consistent experience when tabbing.

- **Custom Hooks**  
  I created reusable hooks (`useWindowSize`, `usePopoverDismiss`, `usePopoverLayout`) to encapsulate state and logic around resizing, closing behavior (Escape key & outside click), and layout updates.

### Continued development

There are several improvements and refinements I'd like to explore in future iterations of this project:

- **Refactor positioning system using `transform`**  
  Currently using `top`/`left` for popover positioning; switching to `transform: translate` will allow for smoother, GPU-accelerated animations.

- **Add shift logic**  
  Implementing custom "shift" logic to nudge the popover into view when it's close to the viewport edge‚Äîthis will work alongside the existing flip behavior for a more robust experience.

- **Manual focus management**  
  Remove the dependency on `react-focus-lock` and handle focus trapping and return manually for better understanding and control of accessibility concerns.

- **Reusable popover primitives**  
  Consider extracting and abstracting logic into more reusable hooks and components, such as a generalized popover or tooltip system that could be reused across projects.

This challenge served as a great learning opportunity in building popover logic manually
